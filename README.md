# C# Calendar Application

Since the new Windows 11 update has broken the native Windows Calendar application on my computer I made my own.

## Features

- **View Monthly Calendar**: Displays a full month view where users can navigate between months.
- **Holiday's Included**: Uses Api calls to show each holiday on the Calendar

## Installation
To run this application, you will need:
- .NET Runtime: Ensure you have the [.NET runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet) installed on your machine.

**Clone the repository and compile yourself or download Calendar.exe to run**
