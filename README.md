# C# Calendar Application

Due to recent compatibility issues with a Windows 11 update that has affected my native Windows Calendar, I have developed a simple custom calendar application to replace it.

## Features

- **View Monthly Calendar**: Displays a full month view where users can navigate between months.
- **Holiday's Included**: Integrates API calls to display public holidays directly on the calendar.

## Installation
To run this application, you will need:
- .NET Runtime: Ensure you have the [.NET runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet) installed on your machine.

**Clone the repository and compile yourself or download Calendar.exe to run**
